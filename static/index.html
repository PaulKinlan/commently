    <h1>Commently</h1>
    <p>
      Maybyly I am taking the naming too far, but this is a simple service that
      allows you to embed comments into your blogging platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comments are synchronized with Buzz based on the feed that you push
      to Buzz.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is super simple to start, simply embed the following javascript into 
      your blog or website
    </p>
    <h2>The 10 second "Getting Started" guide</h2>
    <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  var handler = function(data) {
    // data is an Buzz activity
    
    // data.replies is a list of the replies to the thread
    
    // data.likes is a list of the user likes on the thread
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="/lib/comments.js?title=[Blog Title]&username=[Username]&callback=handler"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>
    Simply replace <em>[Username]</em> with your buzz name (paul.kinlan in my
    case); replace [Blog Title] with a url encoded title of your article as it
    appears in your ATOM or RSS feed; fill out the "handler" function with logic
    to construct a nice looking area for the comments.
